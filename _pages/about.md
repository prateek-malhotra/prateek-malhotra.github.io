- 🔭 **I'm a Solar Analyst at <a href="https://www.futr.energy/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Futr Energy</a> working on SaaS platform, fault detection, ML models and digital twin of utility-scale solar plants.**

- 👨‍🔬 **My PhD research is investigating structure-property relationships of organic semiconductors and predicting power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells.**

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning MLOps.**

- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on ML models for Solar Energy related projects (Utility-scale / Organic Solar Cells)**

- 💬 **Ask me about Solar Energy, Machine Learning.** 


# 💼 Work Experience
**👨‍💻 Solar Analyst**
◦ Solar plant MPPT/SMB level fault detection and revenue loss calculation pipeline: Plant generation is examined on MPPT/SMB level to find anomaly type, downtime, and revenue loss due to individual anomaly.
◦ Solar plant monitoring parameters calculation for dashboard and data analytics: All photovoltaic parameters
required for solar plant monitoring, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Creating new interactive yearly graphs for individual inverters and complete plant generation.
◦ Fault detection using thermal images (infrared images): YOLOV7 model is created to detect various solar panel faults using infrared images (thermal images) of solar plant captured using drone
◦ Automating solar plant twin generation : Twin is created using tif and shp files. With following data using osgeo python library for geoanalytics, ai model is made.
